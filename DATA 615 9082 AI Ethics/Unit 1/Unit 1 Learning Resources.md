AITHORITY: AI Technology Insights](https://aithority.com/machine-learning/ai-in-healthcare-10-best-ways-how-chatgpt-is-revolutionizing-medicine-and-patient-care/): This resource provides good examples of specific ways large language models (ChatGPT) are revolutionizing medicine and patient care. From Analyst, A. (2023, April 26). AI in healthcare: 10 best ways how CHATGPT is revolutionizing medicine and patient care. AiThority.
- [Introduction to Powerful Machine Learning Algorithms](https://vinodsblog.com/2018/03/26/machine-learning-introduction-to-its-algorithms-mlalgos/)): This short and relatively non-technical source provides an outline of the main machine learning algorithms. Emphasis is placed on having a business case for using machine learning. From Sharma, V. (n.d.). Introduction to powerful machine learning algorithms. Vinod Sharma’s Blog.
- [Data Science and Its Relationship to Big Data and Data-Driven Decision Making](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256439081_Data_Science_and_Its_Relationship_to_Big_Data_and_Data-Driven_Decision_Making): This journal article explains what data science really is and what it has to offer to improve decision-making. From Provost, F., & Fawcett, T. (2013). Data science and its relationship to big data and data-driven decision making. Big Data 1(1), 51–59. https://doi.org/10.1089/big.2013.1508.
- [The Decision Dilemma: How More Data Causes Anxiety and Decision Paralysis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9MSJBMMkno): This video shows a thorough discussion of a recent large study on whether more data leads to better decision-making and, if so, how. Spoiler alert—it doesn’t always!
