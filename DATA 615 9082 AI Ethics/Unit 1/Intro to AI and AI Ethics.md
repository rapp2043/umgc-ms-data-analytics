AI has many aspects and areas of usage. (See the required readings for a good perspective on several areas of AI.) Moreover, some aspects of AI warrant special attention.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI that involves the use of data, algorithms, and statistical models to allow systems to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions.

Using patterns and inference factors from past data, ML encompasses a variety of algorithmic methods and approaches to develop accurate models for use with current data. ML model types include:

- **Supervised learning:** models are trained using labeled data
- **Unsupervised learning:** patterns are discerned from unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement learning:** agents learn by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards

ML models are being used especially in applications requiring decision-making assistance. As AI seeks to emulate human-like decision processes and cognition in machines, ML, predictive modeling, and prescriptive modeling collectively offer the tools and methodologies to achieve this goal.

Another related area of AI that merits special attention is that of large language models (LLM). Large language models (LLM) are a type of ML algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content. LLM models can be taught to recognize and generate patterns in photos, text, audio, and other various data. Partly because of their enormous size and amount of training data (often tens of millions of examples) used to develop them, LLMs are prone to having elements of bias and unfairness.

These advanced predictive models do, however, also introduce complexities in understanding and explaining the approaches and interpreting as well as accepting and applying the results. The ability to adequately assess the consistency, clarity, and credibility of advanced models is crucial to their acceptance by decision-makers. Further, concerns over bias and other ethical violations are growing due to the opacity of the models. Bias can intentionally or unintentionally seep into large complex ML and LLM models and be unobserved, leading to improper or unfair outcomes.

## Universal Ethical Principles

There is a broad consensus on universal ethical principles, such as respect for human dignity, autonomy, justice, and fairness. These principles are reflected in international human rights law, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the ethical codes of many professions.

However, some ethical issues are more complex and have less consensus. For example, there is disagreement about the ethics of abortion, euthanasia, and the use of animals in research. Additionally, there may be cultural differences in how ethical principles are interpreted and applied.

For example, in some cultures, it is considered more important to respect the authority of elders, while in other cultures, it is considered more important to promote individual autonomy. In some cultures, it is considered more important to maintain social harmony, while in others, it is considered more important to speak out against injustice.

When building AI systems, it is important to be aware of these ethical challenges. We should strive to build AI systems aligned with universal ethical principles, such as respect for human dignity, autonomy, justice, and fairness. We should also be mindful of cultural differences and avoid building AI systems that could harm or discriminate against certain groups of people.
- **Transparenc**y: AI systems should be transparent and accountable. We should be able to understand how AI systems make decisions and hold them accountable for their actions.
- **Fairness:** AI systems should be fair and unbiased. They should not discriminate against certain groups of people or make decisions that are unfair or unjust.
- **Privacy:** AI systems should respect people's privacy. They should not collect or use data about people without their consent.
- **Safety:** AI systems should be safe and reliable. They should not be used to develop or deploy weapons or other systems that could threaten human safety.
- **Benefit:** AI systems should be used for good. They should be used to benefit humanity and to solve important problems.

Those developing or using ML and other AI models must be aware of (as well as mitigate as far as possible) the possibility of bias in the models.
