# Unit 1 Discussion: Getting to the Root Cause of a Problem
## Overview
Discussions are an important part of each course, and you are required to participate in the discussions.

Two types of participation are required: 1) a substantive initial post and 2) two substantive response posts. Please post an initial post by Friday and at least two response posts by Tuesday of each discussion unit.

- The initial post is your input (answer, idea, or solution) to the discussion prompt. It should contain enough depth and detail to provide a good understanding of your learning progress relevant to the unit topic.
- Response posts contain your comments to other students' initial posts. A minimum of two response posts are required for each unit. These also should be insightful and provide constructive feedback to fellow students.

Please post an initial post by **Friday** and at least two response posts by **Tuesday**.

Discussion
You and your classmates will be investigating the root cause of a problem.

Start by reading the learning resources about root cause analysis and using the 5 whys technique.

Think about a problem that you have encountered in real life. It could be a company you interact with, a problem you’ve heard about in the news, or a problem you’ve encountered in your personal life. Think of a problem with enough complexity and that you know enough about to dig in. Your classmates will be participating, so try to share a problem that is public or common enough that they can help brainstorm.

Once you have a problem, you will complete the 5 whys technique explained in the article. The first step is to assemble a team; you will start as a team of one—yourself! However, classmates might be able to provide some insight as well. Make sure to share links to any articles that support your discussion. Create a discussion post that answers the following questions below and includes the 5 whys you answered in your analysis.

- What problem do you want to investigate? How does it affect you or others?
- What performance or opportunity gaps does the problem create? Why are these gaps important to address?
- How would you describe the problem clearly and concisely?
- What data or information could you collect to analyze the problem? How would you collect it?
- What are some possible causes of the problem? How did you identify them?
- After reading your classmates’ posts, can you think of alternative answers to any of their “why” questions? If so, share your version of the 5 whys analysis. It’s very possible to have multiple root causes of a problem.
- Read through your classmates’ responses to the data they would collect and analyze. Can you think of any data and data sources that your classmates did not list in their posts?
